## ✨ Features

### 🏞️ Soil Data Selector

Easily extract soil data from the **WoSIS (December 2023)** dataset for a chosen location, depth, and date range. The extracted data is available for download in the following formats:

- **GeoPackage** (`.gpkg`)
- **CSV** (`.csv`)

### 📊 Visualize Soil Data

Get an **in-depth understanding** of your dataset with multiple visualization options:

- **Upload** your dataset and filter by bounding coordinates or date range
- Identify **missing values**
- Analyze **distribution** of numerical columns
- View **time-series changes** for specific columns based on date range, mean, median, sum, or count
- Generate a **spatial heatmap** for any selected column

### 🔮 Make Predictions

Leverage **pre-trained AI models** to make predictions on a new dataset. Follow the provided instructions to obtain the dataset and generate predictions.

## 🛠️ For Developers & AI Engineers

### ⚙️ Train Regression Models

Train a regression model using one of the **six available models**:

- 🌳 **Random Forest Regressor** (`RandomForestRegressor()`)
- 📈 **Gradient Boosting Regressor** (`GradientBoostingRegressor()`)
- 📊 **Linear Regression** (`LinearRegression()`)
- 🔍 **Support Vector Regressor** (`SVR()`)
- 📏 **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor** (`KNeighborsRegressor()`)
- 🧠 **MLP Regressor (Neural Network)** (`MLPRegressor()`)

🔍 The models are **validated** based on **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**. The best-performing model is **saved** and made available for **download or system use**.

### 📜 List Trained Models

All trained models are listed with their:

- **Performance metrics**
- **Features**
- **Target variables**
- **Download availability**
