🔬 **Empowering scientists to estimate organic carbon deposits and make data-driven decisions for carbon capture and removal.**  


# ⚙️ Tech Stack

This application is built with a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of use. Below is a breakdown of the key technologies used:  

**🖥️ Frontend**
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** – A lightweight, Python-based web framework for building interactive data applications.  
  📚 Find documentation [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/).  

**🗄️ Database**
- **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** – The database can be configured based on your preference.  
  🛠️ Configuration is managed via the `.env` file.  
  ➡️ Refer to the sample configuration: [`.env.example`](/.env.example).  

**🚀 Backend & Core Logic**
- **Python** – The primary language used for data processing, model execution, and API interactions.  
- **Machine Learning & AI** – Integrates AI models for carbon estimation and data analysis.  

**🛠️ DevOps & Configuration**
- **Environment Variables** – Stored in a `.env` file for flexible configuration.  
- **Docker (Optional)** – Can be used for containerization to ensure consistency across environments.
